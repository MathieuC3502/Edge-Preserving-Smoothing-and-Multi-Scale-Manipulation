# Edge-Preserving-Smoothing-and-Multi-Scale-Manipulation
The objective of this project is to implement the WLS Filter introduced by Z. Farbman, R. Fattal, D. Lischinski, and R. Szeliski in "Edge-preserving decompositions for multi-scale tone and detail manipulation, ACM Transactions on Graphics (TOG), 2008". Our goal is not to replicate the exact filter developed by the authors, but rather to leverage their findings to create our own implementation.

## :file_folder: Installation
To ensure the functionality of the scripts, the folders **data** and **src** must be placed at the root of the same folder. Downloading and extracting the **.zip** folder should result in a functionnal setup.
